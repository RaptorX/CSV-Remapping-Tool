## Description

This small tool allows you to take one or more CSV files that contain data that you need but that has more heathers than what you want to use, or the headers are not ordered the way that you need it.

Simply select the files that you want to remap, set a list of custom heathers that you want to use, and map the existing heathers to the custom ones and let the program do the rest.
